# -Core-Strategy-Energy-Aware-VM-Placement
This project explores intelligent VM placement strategies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in cloud data centers. Using hybrid bio-inspired algorithms (ACOâ€“PSO), we optimize virtual machine allocation and migration based on energy profiles, SLA constraints, and carbon intensity metrics.
