> Intelligent virtual machine placement strategies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in cloud data centers through hybrid bio-inspired optimization.

# -Core-Strategy-Energy-Aware-VM-Placement
This project explores intelligent VM placement strategies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in cloud data centers. Using hybrid bio-inspired algorithms (ACO–PSO), we optimize virtual machine allocation and migration based on energy profiles, SLA constraints, and carbon intensity metrics.

## 📖 Overview

This project addresses the growing environmental impact of cloud computing infrastructure by implementing advanced VM placement and migration algorithms. Using a hybrid ACO–PSO (Ant Colony Optimization–Particle Swarm Optimization) approach, we optimize virtual machine allocation based on energy profiles, SLA constraints, and real-time carbon intensity metrics.
